# QA solid solutions

This repository contains data and code for the quantum annealing study of solid solutions. The work generated with this code has been submitted for publication.

N.B: This is currently work in progress. The notebook QA_solid_solutions contains the code to generate the data and figures reported in the paper. The python functions contained in QA_solid_solutions_functions.py, article_specific_functions.py and symmetry_functions.py will be collected and distributed as a pip package. We aim to complete this task by the end of September 2024.
